CONTROLS:
Keyboard / Xbox controller
  Arrows / D-Pad- Movement
       Z / A	- Activate tractor beam/drop item
       X / X	- Use ability
       F / Y	- Travel through rift in dropped Warp Rift
       R / Select - Reset the game

NOTE: Several aspects of the game like menu navigation or entering initials
      for a high score will require use of keyboard and mouse, so not everything
      can be done controller only.

HOW TO PLAY: The game consists of a series of caves with hazards, enemies, and powerups.
	     Powerups can be picked up using the tractor beam, and each carries a unique 
             ability that can be used with X. Only one powerup can be equipped at a time, so
             to switch abilities the former ability must be dropped. At the start of the
             level is a mothership with a drop-off and a captain's chair. Dropping items
             into the drop-off will reward points, but remove the item until the level is
             finished. The sooner you turn in an item, the more points it will be worth.
	     Flying into the captain's chair will end the level, awarding bonus points for
	     the final time and health remaining. The goal of the game is to collect as
	     many points as possible as fast as possible and make it out alive.
		Good luck.
